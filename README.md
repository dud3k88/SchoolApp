Backend:
Application for:
- creating locations, i.e. places where new groups will arise (e.g. Primary School No. 1)
- creating groups in a created location (e.g. a group of children in 6-7 in Primary School No. 1)
- similarly creating a Parent
- creating hairstyles, i.e. children who have their parents and are assigned to their groups.

It was hard for me to choose external API applications so I added:
- information about the weather in Wroc≈Çaw
- Euro rate (I know that it has nothing to do :))

Unfortunately, I did not have time to write a Sheduler

63% tested application

Entry in the database in a value greater than the criterion for passing the project (10)

The view layer is not completely polished, but it works :)
